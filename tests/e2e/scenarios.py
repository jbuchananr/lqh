_TRANSLATION_SPEC = """\
# Specification: Multi-Language Translation

## Overview
Translate input text into 5 languages: German, French, Spanish, English, and Chinese.
Output as a JSON object with keys: de, fr, es, en, zh.

## Input Format
- **Type**: Plain text, 1-5 sentences
- **Language**: Any language (auto-detected)
- **Typical length**: 10-100 words

## Output Format
- **Type**: JSON object
- **Keys**: de, fr, es, en, zh
- **Example**: {"de": "...", "fr": "...", "es": "...", "en": "...", "zh": "..."}

## Requirements
1. All 5 target languages must be present in every response
2. Translations must be accurate and natural
3. Preserve proper nouns, brand names, numbers
4. Match the formality level of the source text
5. Handle informal text, slang, and idioms gracefully

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** The weather is nice today.
**Output:** {"de": "Das Wetter ist heute schön.", "fr": "Le temps est beau aujourd'hui.", "es": "El tiempo está bonito hoy.", "en": "The weather is nice today.", "zh": "今天天气很好。"}

## Edge Cases
| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Input already in target language | Include as-is for that language |
| Mixed language input | Translate each part appropriately |
| Very short input (1-2 words) | Still provide all 5 translations |

# Scorer: Multi-Language Translation Quality

Based on: SPEC.md

## Task Description
The model translates input text into 5 languages (de, fr, es, en, zh) as JSON.

## Conversation Format
You will receive the conversation in this format:

```
[User]
<the input text to translate>

[Assistant]
<the model's translation response — this is what you score>
```

Focus your evaluation on the text after `[Assistant]`.

## Scoring Scale
- **9-10**: All 5 translations present, accurate, natural, valid JSON
- **7-8**: All translations present with minor quality issues (small mistranslations, slightly unnatural phrasing)
- **5-6**: Valid JSON but some translations significantly inaccurate or unnatural
- **3-4**: Missing language keys, or multiple translations are wrong
- **1-2**: Output is not valid JSON, or most translations are missing/wrong

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Format Compliance
- The assistant's response must be a valid JSON object (not wrapped in markdown code blocks)
- Must have exactly 5 keys: "de", "fr", "es", "en", "zh"
- No extra keys, no duplicate keys

### 2. Translation Accuracy
- Meaning preserved across all languages
- No hallucinated content added
- No significant parts of the input omitted

### 3. Natural Language Quality
- Translations read naturally in each target language
- Appropriate formality level matching the input

### 4. Completeness
- All 5 languages present in the JSON
- Full input text translated (not truncated mid-sentence)

## Critical Failures (automatic score <= 3)
- Output is not valid JSON
- More than 1 language key missing
- Translation is completely wrong (different meaning)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

_HELPDESK_SPEC = """\
# Specification: IT Helpdesk Tool-Calling Agent

## Overview
Build an IT helpdesk assistant that uses tools to check system status, create
support tickets, and restart services. The assistant receives natural language
requests from employees and calls the appropriate tool.

## Available Tools

### check_system_status
- **Description**: Check the current status of an IT system or service
- **Parameters**:
  - `system_name` (string, required): Name of the system (e.g., "email", "vpn", "database")
- **Returns**: JSON with status (up/down/degraded), uptime, last_incident

### create_ticket
- **Description**: Create a support ticket for an issue
- **Parameters**:
  - `title` (string, required): Brief title of the issue
  - `description` (string, required): Detailed description of the problem
  - `priority` (string, required): "low", "medium", "high", or "critical"
  - `category` (string, required): "network", "software", "hardware", "access"
- **Returns**: JSON with ticket_id, status, estimated_resolution_time

### restart_service
- **Description**: Restart a specific IT service
- **Parameters**:
  - `service_name` (string, required): Name of the service to restart
  - `reason` (string, required): Reason for the restart
- **Returns**: JSON with success (boolean), new_status, restart_time

## Input Format
- Natural language from employees describing IT issues
- May be vague ("email is broken") or specific ("can't connect to VPN from home office")

## Output Format
- The assistant calls the appropriate tool with correct arguments
- After receiving tool results, provides a helpful response to the employee

## Requirements
1. Correctly identify which tool to use based on the employee's request
2. Extract correct parameters from natural language
3. Handle ambiguous requests by asking for clarification or making reasonable assumptions
4. Provide clear, non-technical explanations of tool results

## Examples

### Example 1
**User**: "The VPN is acting weird, I can't connect from home"
**Assistant**: [calls check_system_status(system_name="vpn")]
**Tool result**: {"status": "degraded", "uptime": "45 mins", "last_incident": "VPN gateway overloaded"}
**Assistant**: "The VPN is currently experiencing some issues — it's in a degraded state..."

### Example 2
**User**: "My email hasn't been working for 2 hours, this is urgent"
**Assistant**: [calls create_ticket(title="Email not working", description="Employee reports email down for 2 hours", priority="high", category="software")]
