"""Task catalog for the base-vs-instruct benchmark.

A ``Task`` ties together:
  - the datagen pipeline (loaded by file path by the engine),
  - the judge scorer (a 0-10 rubric, written to the workdir and consumed by
    ``lqh.scoring.run_scoring``),
  - the system prompt (baked into the ChatML by the pipeline; mirrored here
    only for reference/reporting — it is NOT re-applied at eval time).

The system prompt lives in each pipeline module (it is baked into every
generated row, which is what train/eval/score all read). We import it here so
there is a single source of truth.

_TRANSLATION_SCORER = """\
# English→German translation scorer

The user gave an English sentence. The assistant should output ONLY the German
translation — no preamble, no surrounding quotes, no English, no commentary.

Score 0-10 on BOTH meaning fidelity and format discipline:

- 10: Accurate, fluent German AND nothing but the German (no extras).
- 8-9: Accurate German with only a tiny format slip (a trailing period, an
       outer quote).
- 5-7: Correct German but wrapped in chatty prose ("Sure, in German that's
       '...'.") or with leftover English preamble.
- 3-4: German present but meaning is wrong/partial, or heavy extra text.
- 0-2: Empty, still English, a refusal, or unrelated.

Return JSON exactly: `{"score": <int 0-10>, "reasoning": "<one sentence>"}`.
"""

# Event-extraction scorer

The user gave a free-text event invitation. The assistant should output ONLY a
single JSON object with exactly these keys: title, date, time, location,
organizer — each value taken from the message.

Score 0-10:

- 10: Valid JSON, exactly those five keys, every value correct, NOTHING else
      (no code fences, no prose).
- 8-9: All values correct but a minor format issue (code fence, extra
       whitespace, key reordering only).
- 5-7: Valid JSON but one field wrong/missing, or wrapped in commentary.
- 3-4: Malformed JSON or several fields wrong.
- 0-2: Not JSON, empty, a refusal, or unrelated.

Return JSON exactly: `{"score": <int 0-10>, "reasoning": "<one sentence>"}`.
"""

_CLASSIFICATION_SCORER = """\
# Sentiment-classification scorer

The user gave a short review. The assistant should output ONLY a JSON object
{"sentiment": "<label>"} where <label> is exactly one of positive, negative,
neutral, and matches the review's overall sentiment.

Score 0-10:

- 10: Valid JSON, single "sentiment" key, correct label, nothing else.
- 8-9: Correct label but a minor format slip (code fence, extra whitespace).
- 5-7: Correct label buried in prose, OR valid JSON with a borderline-but-
       defensible label on a genuinely mixed review.
- 3-4: Wrong label, or malformed JSON.
- 0-2: Not JSON / no label, empty, a refusal, or unrelated.

Judge the label against the review's actual sentiment, not against any label
word in the text. Return JSON exactly:
`{"score": <int 0-10>, "reasoning": "<one sentence>"}`.
"""

_MESSY_EXTRACTION_SCORER = """\
# Messy support-thread extraction scorer

The user gave a noisy support-thread excerpt containing stale values,
corrections, and distractors. The assistant should output ONLY a single JSON
object with exactly these keys: customer_name, account_id, requested_action,
effective_date, priority, owner. Values must reflect the latest corrected
request, not earlier superseded values. Missing values should be null.

Score 0-10:

- 10: Valid JSON, exactly those six keys, all latest values correct, no prose.
- 8-9: All latest values correct with only a minor format issue.
- 5-7: Valid JSON but one or two fields are stale, missing, or wrong.
- 3-4: Malformed JSON or several fields wrong/stale.
- 0-2: Not JSON, empty, refusal, or unrelated.

Return JSON exactly: `{"score": <int 0-10>, "reasoning": "<one sentence>"}`.
"""

_STYLE_REWRITE_SCORER = """\
# Tone/style rewrite scorer

The user gave a flawed support reply, a requested tone/style, required facts,
banned phrases, and length/style constraints. The assistant should output ONLY
the rewritten reply.

Score 0-10 on all of: fact preservation, requested tone, removal of banned
phrases, concision, and natural support-writing quality.

- 10: Preserves every required fact, removes every banned phrase, matches the
      requested tone, obeys length/style constraints, and reads naturally.
- 8-9: Strong rewrite with only a small tone, length, or phrasing issue.
- 5-7: Preserves most facts but is generic, too wordy, slightly off-tone, or
       keeps one minor forbidden-style artifact.
- 3-4: Drops/changes important facts, keeps banned phrases, or ignores tone.
- 0-2: Empty, refusal, unrelated, or mostly copies the flawed draft.

Return JSON exactly: `{"score": <int 0-10>, "reasoning": "<one sentence>"}`.
