"""The benchmark's single eval primitive: LOCAL inference + judge scoring.

This is deliberately the *only* way the benchmark measures a model, so the
three reported points (baseline, best-SFT, best-DPO) are apples-to-apples:

  1. spawn ``python -m lqh.infer`` on the model + eval set (local GPU; the
     base/instruct/checkpoint distinction is transparent to
     ``load_for_inference``), which strips each trailing assistant turn,
     generates a prediction, and writes ``predictions.parquet``;
  2. call ``lqh.scoring.run_scoring`` over those predictions with the task's
     judge rubric (``run_inference=False`` — the assistant turn already IS the
     prediction). The judge is an API call (``judge:<size>``); only the GPU
     inference is local.

This is exactly what the ``start_local_eval`` tool does, minus the TUI watcher
that would otherwise drive the scoring step — here the script drives it.

The system prompt is baked into the eval parquet rows by the datagen pipeline,
so we don't re-apply it here; ``lqh.infer`` already uses the row's own system
message.
