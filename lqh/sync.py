"""Sync backends for local and remote training runs.

The ``SyncBackend`` protocol abstracts file transfer so the same
subprocess file protocol works whether training runs locally, on a
remote GPU box via SSH, or in the cloud via S3.

For now only ``LocalSync`` (a no-op) is implemented.  Future backends:
``RsyncSync(host, ssh_key)``, ``S3Sync(bucket, prefix)``.
