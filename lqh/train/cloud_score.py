"""In-sandbox scoring helpers for the DPO + SFT-sweep cloud pathways.

When a training subprocess runs on a SSH backend, the laptop-side
``RemoteRunWatcher`` (lqh/remote/watcher.py) is the one scoring
predictions, generating golden trajectories, and writing
``preferences.parquet`` (DPO) / ``eval_result.json`` (per-checkpoint
SFT eval) back to the run directory.

When the same subprocess runs in a cloud sandbox, that ping-pong
breaks: ``CloudBackend.sync_file_to_remote`` raises ``NotImplementedError``
because the sandbox filesystem isn't reachable from the laptop. The
fix is to do the scoring *inside the sandbox*, using the scoped
``LQH_API_TOKEN`` injected at submit time.

This module is the in-sandbox half of that. The trainer calls into
``score_dpo_iter_inline()`` after writing ``predictions.parquet`` +
``iter_request.json``, which then runs ``run_scoring`` + ``generate_golden``
synchronously, writing ``preferences.parquet`` directly. The
``wait_for_file(preferences.parquet)`` in the trainer's main loop
then succeeds immediately.

Detection: ``is_cloud_mode()`` returns true only when both
``LQH_API_TOKEN`` and ``LQH_BASE_URL`` are set in the environment.
The cloud launcher injects both; SSH backends
inject neither (laptop watcher does the work).

If we're not in cloud mode, the helpers are no-ops — the laptop
watcher path keeps working unchanged.
